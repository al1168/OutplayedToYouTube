# OutplayedToYouTube
The goal of this project is to automate download and uploading video from a website called Outplayed which records gameplay highlights.

The inspiration for this project is that for almost 8 months to a year, I've been storing my highlights with outplayed via a cloud link which I just found out expire within a year. 
I want to save these videos for memories C:
The goal with this project is to create it as a backend service and using a frontend service to call this as like an api 

[Outfront](https://github.com/al1168/OutFront)https://github.com/al1168/OutFront
Is a simple frontend to utilize this backend to upload youtube videos
